# Run/Walk Tracker

## Fitness application that will track user's movements in real-time

---

The Run/Walk Tracker is a web application that will track the user's movements as they go for a run or walk. The app will also log the user data and display it to the main page. The purpose of this application is to give beginning runners or walkers a tool that they can use to log their data without having to worry about what fitness accounts to sign up for or wearable technologies to purchase. In addition, this app will not collect any health data from users. Instead, every time the user goes for a run or walk, the Run/Walk Tracker will log the  distance, time, and pace. This web application will generally target users between 45-65 years old.
